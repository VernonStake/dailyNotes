    - Caught up with Jesse.

<<<<<<< HEAD
    - Helping out Lynchy investigate a SEG FAULT in the StakeInstrumentService.
=======
    - Forgot how messed up my dev env was after having to restore OS, fixed it up
    nicely.

    - Tried helping out Lynchy investigate a SEG FAULT in the StakeInstrumentService,
    but env issues made it take forever for indexing to occur. Eventually got to a
    point where I could give Lynchy some pointers on getting a local to run in to
    debug seg fault.

    - Recalibrated and caught up to where I left off before getting sick.

    - Got the gRPC code generated from openAPI -> proto -> go using standard terminal
    commands, looks very likely that bazel should be used to automate this workflow,
    seeing it pop up everywhere. Will raise a ticket to POC soon.
