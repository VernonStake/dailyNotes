    #TODO Bug: Missing @PreAuthorizeStakeStandardUser annotation

    - Helped Kendall to sort out test case.

    - Got end point working for triggering trending caclulation using only the ordercount
    information.

    - Ran into nasty bug with RedisCache when storing a value as Long, but converts
    to Integer when smaller in redis, cannot deserialize it to Long.

    Solution is to store the score as a string value to not lose any precision.
